<p> This school claims to take personal care of each student ensuring that he is all the time relaxed and this is the peculiarity of this school. The enlightened people of the district Fatehabad who have watched the functioning of our school with considerable critical interest are the witness to the fact that the school has made a concrete academic contribution to the society. It has been reckoned as a school with difference perhaps unique in itself. The teaching approaches and the integrity of the staff and the administration are of the quality that a common school lacks. A particular mention must be made of the fact that what we know about education is being used very ingeniously to suit the needs of the children of our school. </p></div>
